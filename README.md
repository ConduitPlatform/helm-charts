# Conduit Helm Charts

Helm charts for [Conduit](https://getconduit.dev/) backend.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add conduit-platform <link-coming-soon>
```

You can then run `helm search repo conduit-platform` to see the charts.
